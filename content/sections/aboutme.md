[Curriculum Vitae](/pdf/Enke_cv.pdf)

My research is in behavioral and experimental economics, cultural economics, and political economy. Much of much current work focuses on complexity and  cognitive uncertainty, as well as the political consequences and cultural origins of heterogeneity in moral values. 

I received my Ph.D. in 2016 from the University of Bonn and subsequently joined Harvard's Economics Department. Since 2018, I also serve as Associate Editor at the Journal of the European Economic Association. At Harvard, I teach a Ph.D. course on Experimental Economics and an undergraduate class on Economics and Morality; please see [here](https://scholar.harvard.edu/benke) for more information.
