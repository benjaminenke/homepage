My research is in behavioral and experimental economics, with frequent applications in political and cultural economics. Methodologically, my work relies on a combination of experiments and surveys. In substantive terms, my work focuses on (i) the micro-foundations of bounded rationality in belief formation and choice and (ii) heterogeneity in moral universalism (and cultural variation more generally).
