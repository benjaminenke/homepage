[Curriculum Vitae](/pdf/Enke_cv.pdf)

My research is in behavioral and experimental economics, with frequent applications in political and cultural economics. My work focuses on two lines of inquiry. First, experimental work on the micro-foundations of bounded rationality in belief formation and choice. Second, experimental and survey-based research on heterogeneity in moral universalism (and cultural variation more generally). 

At Harvard, I teach a Ph.D. course on Experimental Economics and an undergraduate class on Economics and Morality, please see  here(https://scholar.harvard.edu/benke) for for information.
