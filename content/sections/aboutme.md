[Curriculum Vitae](/pdf/Enke_cv.pdf)

My research is in behavioral and experimental economics, cultural economics, and political economy. My work focuses on two lines of inquiry. First, I conduct experimental research to understand how the interplay of bounded rationality and complexity shapes economic decisions and beliefs. Second, I employ a combination of experimental and survey-based techniques to shed light on the economic and political relevance of heterogeneity in moral universalism (and cultural variation more generally). 

I received my Ph.D. in 2016 from the University of Bonn and subsequently joined Harvard's Economics Department. Since 2018, I also serve as Associate Editor at the Journal of the European Economic Association.

At Harvard, I teach a Ph.D. course on Experimental Economics and an undergraduate class on Economics and Morality; please see [here](https://scholar.harvard.edu/benke) for more information. Students can sign up for office hours [here](https://app.acuityscheduling.com/schedule.php?owner=12646405).
