My research is in behavioral and experimental economics, with frequent applications in political and cultural economics. My work focuses on two lines of inquiry. First, experimental work on the micro-foundations of bounded rationality in belief formation and choice. Second, experimental and survey-based research on heterogeneity in moral universalism (and cultural variation more generally).
