  abstract: >
    This paper presents a new set of stylized facts about the global variation in universalism, leveraging hypothetical money allocation tasks deployed in representative samples of 64,000 people from 60 countries. Our data reveal large variation in universalism within and across countries, which almost entirely reflects heterogeneity in people's moral views regarding how to treat different types of relationships. These moral views vary systematically with age, gender and religiosity. Universalism is strongly predictive of relevant outcomes such as civic engagement and left-wing economic and social policy views, in particular in the rich West. Across countries, universalism varies with the economic, political and religious organization of societies. We provide tentative evidence that experience with democracy makes people more universalist. Overall, our results show that moral universalism shapes and is shaped by politico-economic outcomes across the globe.

  abstract: > 
     Motivated by novel survey evidence, this paper develops a theory of political behavior in which values are a luxury good: the relative weight voters place on values rather than material considerations increases in income. The model predicts (i) voters who are sufficiently rich to afford voting left; (ii) that more rich than poor people vote against their material interests; (iii) that Democrats are internally more fragmented than Republicans; (iv) that income and voting Republican are positively correlated across voters but negatively across states; and (v) the realignment of rich moral liberals and poor moral conservatives. We test our predictions empirically.

     This paper provides field evidence on the link between morals and political behavior. We develop a theory-guided real-stakes measure of each U.S. district's values on the universalism-particularism continuum, which reflects the degree to which charitable giving decreases as a function of social distance. District universalism is strongly predictive of local Democratic vote shares, legislators' roll-call voting, and the moral content of Congressional speeches. These results hold in both across- and within-party analyses. Overall, spatial heterogeneity in universalism is a substantially stronger predictor of geographic variation in political outcomes than traditional economic variables such as income or education.

- title: "Associative Memory, Beliefs and Market Interactions"
  pdflink: "/pdf/Memory.pdf"
  coauthors: "Frederik Schwerter and Florian Zimmermann"
  abstract: >
     Recent theories and narratives highlight the potential role of associative recall in driving overreaction in expectations and market behavior. Based on a simple model, we test this idea through a series of experiments in which news are communicated with memorable contexts. Because participants predominantly remember those past signals that get cued by the current one, their beliefs about fundamentals strongly overreact to news and exhibit systematic history-dependence. In a betting market experiment, associative recall translates into overreaction in market prices, which makes realized prices too extreme. Our results highlight the importance of associative memory for beliefs and economic decisions.

  coauthors: "Thomas Graeber and Ryan Oprea"
  abstract: >
      We provide experimental evidence that core intertemporal choice anomalies -- including extreme short-run impatience, structural estimates of present bias, hyperbolicity and transitivity violations -- are driven by complexity rather than time or risk preferences.  First, all anomalies also arise in structurally similar atemporal decision problems involving valuation of iteratively discounted (but immediately paid) rewards. These computational errors are strongly predictive of intertemporal decisions.  Second,  intertemporal choice anomalies are highly correlated with indices of complexity responses including cognitive uncertainty and choice inconsistency.  We show that model misspecification resulting from ignoring behavioral responses to complexity severely inflates structural estimates of present bias.

- title: "Herding, Warfare and a Culture of Honor: Global Evidence"
  pdflink: "/pdf/Culture_of_Honor.pdf"
  coauthors: "Yiming Cao, Armin Falk, Paola Giuliano and Nathan Nunn"
  abstract: >
     According to the widely known `culture of honor' hypothesis from social psychology, traditional herding practices have generated a value system conducive to revenge-taking and violence. We test the economic significance of this idea at a global scale using a combination of ethnographic and folklore data, global information on conflicts, and multinational surveys. We find that the descendants of herders have significantly more frequent and severe conflict today, and report being more willing to take revenge in global surveys. We conclude that herding practices generated a functional psychology that plays a role in shaping conflict across the globe.

  book: "Annual Review of Economics"
  bookprefix: "In preparation for the "
  abstract: >
    This paper reviews and synthesizes the fast-growing economics literature on heterogeneity in moral values regarding in-group members and strangers. I outline different ways of formalizing and measuring these values, and then turn to discussing their politico-economic consequences. Heterogeneity in moral universalism has been shown to be helpful for understanding outcomes such as policy views, voting behavior, social cooperation, the internal organization of firms, friendship networks, donations, and the abolitionist movement. Looking at the origins of heterogeneity in morality, various contributions have shed light on the roles of kinship systems, market exposure, democracy, Christianity and ecology. A main takeaway that emerges from the literature is that heterogeneity in morality often reflects differences in economic incentives that emerge from the prevailing institutions and natural conditions, such that politico-economic outcomes both shape and are shaped by moral values. I discuss open questions and potential new applications.
