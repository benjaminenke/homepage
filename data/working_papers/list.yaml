  abstract: >
     This paper experimentally studies the role of associative recall for belief formation. Information is often embedded in memorable contexts, which may cue the asymmetric recall of similar past news through associative memory. We design a simple and tightly controlled theory-driven experiment, in which participants observe sequences of signals about hypothetical companies. Here, identical signal realizations are communicated with identical contexts: stories and images. Because participants predominantly remember those past signals that get cued by the current context, participants' expectations strongly overreact to recent news. Investigating various model comparative statics and limits of the role of associative memory, we find support for the model's predictions about how overreaction depends on exogenous variation in the signal history; the correlation between signals and contexts; and the experimentally-induced scope for forgetting and associative memory. We use our experimental data to structurally estimate the model parameters that govern the strength of imperfect and associative recall.

     Because many economic decisions are difficult, people may exhibit cognitive uncertainty: subjective uncertainty about what the optimal action is. This paper shows that cognitive uncertainty predicts economic beliefs and actions, and that it provides a unifying lens for understanding behavioral anomalies in how people think about probabilities. The main idea is that when people are cognitively uncertain, they act as if they compress objective probabilities towards a cognitive default that is given by an ignorance prior. By experimentally measuring and exogenously manipulating cognitive uncertainty in different decision contexts, our analysis brings together and partially explains a large set of empirical regularities in choice under risk, choice under ambiguity, belief updating, and survey forecasts of economic variables. These include the probability weighting function, the fourfold pattern of risk attitudes, ambiguity-insensitivity, base rate insensitivity, conservatism, sample proportion effects, and predictable overoptimism and -pessimism in economic forecasts. Because people's reported cognitive uncertainty systematically varies as a function of the objective probabilities in a decision problem, our framework also sheds light on the pronounced inverse S-shaped response patterns that pervade different literatures in behavioral economics.

 - title: "Cognitive Uncertainty in Intertemporal Choice"
   pdflink: "/pdf/cognitive_uncertainty.pdf"
   coauthors: "Thomas Graeber"
   abstract: >
     Because evaluating intertemporal tradeoffs is often cognitively difficult, people may exhibit cognitive uncertainty: subjective uncertainty about the utility-maximizing action. We study the idea that, in the presence of cognitive uncertainty, decisions reflect a convex combination of discounted-utility considerations and people's initial, pre-deliberation reaction to a choice problem. As a result, observed intertemporal decisions look as if the decision-maker partially ``lumps different time delays together.'' In our experiments, cognitive uncertainty sheds light on various well-known empirical regularities, such as the puzzle that people are often extremely impatient in the short run but appear considerably more patient over long horizons. We also establish tight links between cognitive uncertainty, choice variability and subadditive discounting.  Investigating implications for choice architecture, we find that cognitively uncertain participants are more likely to follow the advice of outside experts to act in more patient ways. The results of model estimations suggest that both bounded rationality in the form of cognitive uncertainty and a desire for immediate gratification meaningfully contribute to intertemporal choice.

      
- title: "Moral Universalism and the Structure of Ideology"
  pdflink: "/pdf/Universalism_ideology.pdf"
  coauthors: "Ricardo Rodriguez-Padilla and Florian Zimmermann"
  abstract: >
     Throughout the Western world, people's policy views are correlated across domains in a strikingly similar fashion. This paper proposes that what partly explains the structure of ideology is moral universalism: the extent to which people's altruism and trust remain constant as social distance increases. In new large-scale multinational surveys, heterogeneity in universalism descriptively explains why the left and right both simultaneously support and oppose different types of government spending. Moreover, the left-right divide on topics such as redistribution strongly depends on whether people evaluate more or less universalist policies. Large-scale donation data provide additional evidence for the political left's universalism.
