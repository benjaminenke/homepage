     Throughout the Western world, people's policy views are correlated across domains in a strikingly similar fashion. This paper proposes that what partly explains the structure of ideology is moral universalism: the extent to which people's altruism and trust remain constant as social distance increases. In new large-scale multinational surveys, heterogeneity in universalism descriptively explains why the left and right both simultaneously support and oppose different types of government spending. Moreover, the left-right divide on topics such as redistribution strongly depends on whether people evaluate more or less universalist policies. Large-scale donation data provide additional evidence for the political left's universalism.

- title: "Universalism: Global Evidence"
  coauthors: "Alexander Cappelen and Bertil Tungodden"
  abstract: >
     This paper studies the global variation in universalism through a series of hypothetical money allocation tasks deployed in nationally representative samples of 64,000 people from 60 countries. We document that (i) variation in universalism almost entirely reflects heterogeneity in people's moral principles regarding how to treat different types of relationships. (ii) Young, female, poor and atheist people are more universalist around the globe, while correlations with education and urbanicity are specific to rich Western nations. (iii) Individual-level heterogeneity in universalism is strongly predictive of civic engagement and a broad set of left-wing political views, in particular in the developed West. (iv) Universalism exhibits quantitatively large variation across countries, which is related to lower per capita income, Christianity, democracy and weak historical kinship ties. (v) Lifetime exposure analyses suggest that experiencing democracy leads to higher universalism.

- title: "Morals as Luxury Goods and Political Polarization"
  pdflink: "/pdf/Morals_polarization.pdf"
  coauthors: "Mattias Polborn and Alex Wu"
  abstract: > 
    This paper develops a theory of political behavior in which moral values are a luxury good: the relative weight that voters place on moral rather than material considerations increases in income. This idea both generates new testable implications and ties together a broad set of empirical regularities about political polarization in the U.S. For instance, the model predicts (i) the emergence of economically left-wing elites; (ii) that more rich than poor people vote against their material interests; (iii) that within-party heterogeneity is larger among Democrats than Republicans; and (iv) realignment patterns that reflect an increased relevance of moral rather than class-based divisions: rich moral liberals who switch to the Democrats, and poor moral conservatives who swing Republican. Assuming that parties set policies by aggregating their supporters' preferences, the model also predicts increasing polarization on social issues over time. We relate these predictions to known stylized facts, and test our new predictions empirically.

- title: "Associative Memory and Belief Formation"

  abstract: >
     This paper experimentally studies the role of associative recall for belief formation. Information is often embedded in memorable contexts, which may cue the asymmetric recall of similar past news through associative memory. We design a simple and tightly controlled theory-driven experiment, in which participants observe sequences of signals about hypothetical companies. Here, identical signal realizations are communicated with identical contexts: stories and images. Because participants predominantly remember those past signals that get cued by the current context, participants' expectations strongly overreact to recent news. Investigating various model comparative statics and limits of the role of associative memory, we find support for the model's predictions about how overreaction depends on exogenous variation in the signal history; the correlation between signals and contexts; and the experimentally-induced scope for forgetting and associative memory. We use our experimental data to structurally estimate the model parameters that govern the strength of imperfect and associative recall.

    This paper documents the economic relevance of measuring cognitive uncertainty: people's subjective uncertainty over their ex-ante utility-maximizing decision. In a series of experiments on choice under risk, the formation of beliefs and forecasts of economic variables, we show that cognitive uncertainty predicts systematic biases in economic decisions and that it can be deployed to provide tests of formal theories. When people are cognitively uncertain -- either endogenously or because the problem is designed to be complex -- their decisions are heavily attenuated functions of objective probabilities, which gives rise to behavior that is regressive to an intermediate option. This insight ties together a wide range of empirical regularities in behavioral economics that are typically viewed as distinct phenomena or even as reflecting preferences, including the probability weighting function in choice under risk; base rate insensitivity, conservatism and sample size effects in belief updating; and predictable overoptimism and -pessimism in  forecasts of economic variables. Our results offer a blueprint for how a simple measurement of cognitive uncertainty generates novel insights about what people find complex and how they respond to it.

- title: "Cognitive Uncertainty in Intertemporal Choice"
  pdflink: "/pdf/CU_intertemporal.pdf"
  coauthors: "Thomas Graeber"
  abstract: >
     This paper studies the relevance of cognitive uncertainty -- subjective uncertainty over one's utility-maximizing action -- for understanding and predicting intertemporal choice. The main idea is that when people are cognitively noisy, such as when a decision is complex, they implicitly treat different time delays to some degree alike. By experimentally measuring and manipulating cognitive uncertainty, we document  three economic implications of this idea. First,  cognitive uncertainty explains various core empirical regularities, such as why people often appear very impatient, why per-period impatience is smaller over long than over short horizons, why discounting is often hyperbolic even when the present is not involved, and why choices frequently violate transitivity. Second, impatience is context-dependent: discounting is substantially more hyperbolic when the decision environment is more complex. Third, cognitive uncertainty matters for choice architecture: people who are nervous about making mistakes are twice as likely to follow expert advice to be more patient.
     
- title: "Confidence, Self-Selection and Bias in the Aggregate"
  pdflink: "/pdf/Confidence_aggregate.pdf"
  coauthors: "Thomas Graeber and Ryan Oprea"
  abstract: >
     Economics experiments have produced widespread evidence that people suffer from a range of cognitive biases. However, unlike experiments, real-world institutions often allow decision makers to self-select out, potentially filtering (or amplifying) the impact of biases on economic aggregates.  We study the economic impacts of such self-selection and how they depend on people's meta-cognitive awareness of their own errors. In a series of online experiments that cover a wide range of classical decision biases, we document large heterogeneity in how cognitive biases are related to the intensity of bets in speculative markets, bids for property rights in auctions and contributions to collective decisions. In some tasks, rational subjects are more confident than their biased counterparts and bet, bid and vote more aggressively. As a result, self-selection tends to filter the effect of irrationalities on aggregate quantities. However, in other tasks, confidence and performance are unrelated or even negatively correlated, so that experimental institutions do not filter errors and sometimes even magnify them. As a methodological blueprint, we show that a simple measure of the relative calibration of confidence strongly predicts the degree to which institutional self-selection filters the effect of irrationalities.     

- title: "Herding, Warfare and a Culture of Honor: Global Evidence"
  pdflink: "/pdf/Culture_of_Honor.pdf"
  coauthors: "Yiming Cao, Armin Falk, Paola Giuliano and Nathan Nunn"
  abstract: >
     According to the widely known `culture of honor' hypothesis from social psychology, traditional herding practices have generated a value system conducive to revenge-taking and violence. We test the economic significance of this idea at a global scale using a combination of ethnographic and folklore data, global information on conflicts, and multinational surveys. We find that the descendants of herders have significantly more frequent and severe conflict today, and report being more willing to take revenge in global surveys. We conclude that herding practices generated a functional psychology that plays a role in shaping conflict across the globe.
